# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

    This project is a back-end application built using MySQL2, Express, Sequelize, and dotenv for an e-commerce site with a command line interface (CLI) and object-relational mapping site that uses various methods for data manipulation, storage, and retrieval using HTTP methods and a RESTUL API.

    By running the schema.sql file in the database folder, MySQL Workbench will create the ecommerce_db and establish the connection with Insomnia Core via the command line interface (CLI) and the specific npm packages as well as MySQL2, Express, Sequelize, and Dotenv will be installed through npm i, npm i mysql2, npm i sequelize, and npm i dotenv.

    If you have successfully installed the node.js packages and seeded the database, run npm start to start the server and connect to localhost:3001/api/ and Using Insomnia Core, you can test all API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
